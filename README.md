# Class 4.3 Write Up

Today's class was a review of some of the more advanced applications of Pandas. We did a review of how to set an index depending on the data, the iloc, loc and get_loc commands, sort_values, groupby, binning and how to do well in an interview. 

It is vital to understand the data with which one is working generally and for index setting. Setting an index is exeptionally important because should one need to concatenate multiple data frames into one compiled data frame, it will be difficult to analyze the data if it is not consistently formatted. 

iloc is used in cases where there is only an integer, i.e. known index, loc is used when you have a string and get_loc is used to find a particular row entry in a column. 

Binning is a very important command that allows dataa to be passed into categories and allows further in depth analysis. 

## Interview Techniques

In an interview, when one is presented with a problem the first step is to repeat the problem back to the interviewer in simple English. The next step is to start thinking through the process aloud so that the interviewer can witness your problem solving techniques. Then once you've chosen the best approach to solve the given problem, defend it. Afterwhich, begin writing the pseudocode, outlining the various steps one would need to solve the problem. Finally, begin writing the code. It is okay if one does not complete the full code, so long as the interviewer sees that the interviewee can think through a problem, the chances of success are higher.
